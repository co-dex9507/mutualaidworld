## Who do we need help from 

### Who do we hope can help - technical

Any kind of software development skills, whether it be front/back end on a browser, or mobile development skills are all welcome and very much in need. We’d also appreciate developers with Data Science/Machine Learning experience. We especially need folks experienced with Ruby on Rails or React to work on Back end API and Front End code respectively.  We have a working 'demo' app but more work is needed to get it online, connect payment capabilities, fix broken links, and do a couple other bits of essential maintenance to prepare it for this use case.

### Who do we hope can help - Non technical

Not a coder? Not to worry! We could use Project Managers, Scrum Masters, UI/UX designers, technical writers, translators and even legal staff, all kinds of things are useful. There's also a whole data science team, but I guess we already mentioned them. 

### Who do we hope can help - Local Organisers

We need locally based organizers who want to use the app to join the collaboration.  So for everyone out there who has a big spreadsheet, first off, yall are heros, embodiments of the compassionate and creative human spirit. And second, we can make your life a lot easier so you can move beyond spreadsheet maintenance and manual matching of needs and resources and start turning your attention to other things that your community needs. We have some ideas already but we really want to build the app that solves the problems that you have so come join our group and tell us about it. 


**Technical or not, your help is very much appreciated**
